Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/reva-portfolio.git
cd reva-portfolio

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Running the Development Server
To start the development server and view the project in your browser:

npm start
# or
yarn start

This will typically open the application at http://localhost:3000.

Building for Production
To create an optimized production build of the application:

npm run build
# or
yarn build

This will compile the project into the build/ directory, which can then be deployed to a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

Customization
Content: Update text in App.js (Hero, About, Project, Contact sections) to reflect your personal information and projects.

Images: Replace placeholder image URLs (https://placehold.co/...) with links to your own hosted images. You would typically upload these to a cloud storage service or your hosting provider.

Contact Form: The contact form currently doesn't send emails. You'll need to integrate a backend service (e.g., Node.js with Nodemailer, Formspree, Netlify Forms) to handle form submissions.

Project Data: Modify the projects array in App.js to include your actual project details, images, and links.

Colors/Styling: Adjust Tailwind CSS classes directly in the components or extend Tailwind's configuration if you need custom colors or styles.
